- The A team -

White lips, pale face
Breathing in snowflakes
Burnt lungs, sour taste
Light's gone, day's end
Struggling to pay rent
Long nights, strange men

And they say
She's in the class A Team
She's stuck in her daydream
Been this way since eighteen
But lately her face seems
Slowly sinking, wasting
Crumbling like pastries
And they scream
The worst things in life come free to her

'Cause she's just under the upper-hand
And goes mad for a couple grams
And she don't want to go outside tonight
'Cause in a pipe, she'll fly to the motherland
And sell love to another man
It's too cold outside
Angels to fly
Angels to fly, mm

Ripped gloves, raincoat
Tried to swim and stay afloat
Dry house, wet clothes
Loose change, bank notes
Weary-eyed and dry throat
Call girl, no phone

They say
She's in the class A Team
She's stuck in her daydream
Been this way since eighteen
But lately her face seems
Slowly sinking, wasting
Crumbling like pastries
And they scream
The worst things in life come free to us

'Cause she's just under the upper-hand
And goes mad for a couple grams
And she don't want to go outside tonight
'Cause in the pipe, she'll fly to the motherlandÂ 
And sell love to another man
It's too cold outside
Angels to fly

Now an angel will die
Covered in white
Closed eyes and hoping for a better life
This time, now we'll fade out tonight
Straight down the line
Just straight down the line, oh, mm

Now they say
She's in the class A Team
She's stuck in her daydream
Been this way since eighteen
But lately her face seems
Slowly sinking, wasting
Crumbling like pastries
And they scream
The worst things in life come free to us

When we're all under the upper-hand
And go mad for a couple grams
And we don't want to go outside tonight
'Cause in the pipe we'll fly to the motherland
And sell love to another man
It's too cold outside
Angels to fly
Angels to fly
Fly, fly
Angels to fly, to fly, to fly
Angels to die
