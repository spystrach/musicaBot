- Moonlight Shadow -

The last that ever she saw him
Carried away by a moonlight shadow
He passed on worried and warning
Carried away by a moonlight shadow.
Lost in a riddle last Saturday night
Far away on the other side.
He was caught in the middle of a desperate fight
And she couldn't find how to push through 

The trees that whisper in the evening
Carried away by a moonlight shadow
Sing a song of sorrow and grieving
Carried away by a moonlight shadow
All she saw was a silhouette of a gun
Far away on the other side.
He was shot six times by a man on the run
And she couldn't find how to push through 

I stay I pray 
I see you in heaven far away
I stay I pray
I see you in heaven one day 

Four a.m. in the morning
Carried away by a moonlight shadow 
I watched your vision forming 
Carried away by a moonlight shadow
Star was light in a silvery night 
Far away on the other side
Will you come to talk to me this night
But she couldn't find how to push through 

I stay I pray 
I see you in heaven far away
I stay I pray
I see you in heaven one day 

Far away on the other side.

I stay I pray 
I see you in heaven far away
I stay I pray
I see you in heaven one day 

[...]
Caught in the middle of a hundred and five
[...]
The night was heavy but the air was alive
She couldn't find how to push through
    Carried away by a moonlight shadow
    Carried away by a moonlight shadow
    Far away on the other side
